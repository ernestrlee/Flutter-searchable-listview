# Flutter-searchable-listview

This searchable listview component is a layout that takes in a Set of unique text values and presents it as a sorted listview.  At the top of the listview, there is a fixed search box.  When a user enters text into the searchbox, the listview will filter out any items that do not contain the search text.  Selecting an item will display a snack bar showing which item is selected.  The selected item will also be highlighted.
